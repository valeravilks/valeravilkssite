Certainly! Here's the text formatted in Markdown:

## Project Philosophy

This section describes the fundamental principles that should be followed for efficiency and standardization in project work.

### Utilizing Sage Theme

- The project is built on the **Sage theme foundation**. Changes that disrupt its standard workflow should be avoided.
- Regular updates from the Sage community should be considered, ensuring compatibility and avoiding conflicts.

### Integration with Acorn by Roots

- **Acorn**, developed by Roots, is used for integrating Laravel components within the Sage theme.
- It offers Laravel tools in Wordpress, including automation through console tools and convenient configuration management.

### Atomic Design Concept

- The project is based on the principles of **Atomic Design**, where each component has its own logic and hierarchy.
- This approach ensures scalability, maintainability, and reusability of components.
- Each component should be loosely coupled with the project and encompass all necessary logic and operational rules.

### Project Work Structure

- Tasks are divided among junior, middle, and senior levels to optimize project costs.
- Junior developers should follow a clear workflow for creating and styling components.
- PRs from less experienced developers should be understandable and require minimal review.

### Creating Instructions and Division of Responsibilities

- Clear instructions for each team role should be established, reducing the need for comprehensive project knowledge.

### Component Testing and Verification

- A testing process for each component and PR is needed to ensure the stability of the site.
- The **Design System** is used for centralized component testing.
- Unit testing for each component's logic and validation of input data is crucial.

### Error Logging

- Implementing a logging system (e.g., Laravel Logging) for real-time error monitoring is essential.

### Project Build and Deployment

- Tools for building the project and deploying it on an SFTP server need to be developed.
- The possibility of using **Acorn** for build automation should be considered.

### CI/CD Process

- Code testing, formatting validation, and build support are necessary.
- Using **CircleCI** with the flexibility to work with different CI platforms is recommended for a universal and simplified deployment process.
